### Using Solaredge Rest API as a meter

My meter is connected to the converter over a (twisted pair?) cable S0.
The SEK5 thus has the consumption values. It also transmits it to the SolarEdge cloud. However so far I did not yet find a way how it re-exports those values over Modbus. So I can not access the consumption locally. My meter is an Eltako DSZ12E
Verbrauchsz√§hler S0 mit 800 Imp/Kwh

Eltako DSZ12E 3x80A

I have no local API/access to it, however the Solaredge REST API has the information it collects

I installed the go tool from Ulrich Schreiner https://gitlab.com/ulrichSchreiner/solaredge referenced under https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/2941

Thus I did not have to modify evcc but could use the existing custom meter / plugin capability.

However I have a private fork on https://github.com/Bodobolero/solaredge-go-library where I made the following changes
- polling interval during the night is 15 minutes
- polling interval during the day (when solarpower is active) is 3 minutes
- this is to ensure I stay within the Solaredge API request quota of 300/day

### Using Weconnect API with Charge brick (Ladeziegel) as a charger

My use case is:

I have a 5.04 kWp (kilo-watt peak) PV.
Because I want to use PV energy to charge my car I do not use a wallbox, instead I have a Green-up socket which supports my 1 phase 10-16 A 240 V charging device that comes with my car.
Since this is our second car we will use it for short distances, usually 2-20 km and the 2.3 kw charging using the green-up socket will be enough to support our usage of the car.

I want an automated solution that decides when to start charging and when to stop charging.
The decision will be based on the SOC of the car (I will charge at any time until I reach a SOC of x % (e.g. 30 % to support my local commute).
I want to charge between 30 % and 80 % when there is enough PV production to support the 2.4 kw charging (with 10 A * 240 V), which means when my production is higher than <current consumption> + 2.4 kw.

For that purpose the S0 800 Imp/kWh meter is totally sufficient.

My car has a mileage of 10.000 km per year, at 20 kwh/100 km that is 2000 kwh / year.
My reimbursement for PV is 13 Eurocent. My energy tarif is 27 cent/kwh.

The total possible savings per year by optimizating the charge time is 27 cent - 13 cent = 14 cent * 2000 kwh.
That means I can save a total of 280 Euro/year.

Now comes the investment argument:
I can buy a cheap e-go wallbox that can be remotely controlled (around 300 Euro) and I can also replace the smart meter.
To modify the house installation I need a certified electrician that will cost me a few hundred Euro.

Which means to get the current implementation of evcc working I need an investment of > 1000 Euro to save 280 Euro per year.

With a few modifications to the software I can achieve the same with just investment in code.

support REST API for SolarEdge in the metering area would save me to replace the meter

support VW We.connect to control the charging instead of requiring a remote-controllable charger would save me to buy a wallbox

Since evcc project owners didn't want my contributions I created a fork and implemented the
vehicle WeConnect API as a charger to start/stop charging and get the current charging state

## Sponsorship

<img src="docs/logo.png" align="right" width="150" />

evcc believes in open source software. We're committed to provide best in class EV charging experience.
Maintaining evcc consumes time and effort. With the vast amount of different devices to support, we depend on community and vendor support to keep evcc alive.

While evcc is open source, we would also like to encourage vendors to provide open source hardware devices, public documentation and support open source projects like ours that provide additional value to otherwise closed hardware. Where this is not the case, evcc requires "sponsor token" to finance ongoing development and support of evcc.

The personal sponsor token requires a [Github Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/evcc-io) and can be requested at [sponsor.evcc.io](https://sponsor.evcc.io/).
